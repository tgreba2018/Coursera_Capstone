These individuals will have different needs and expectations at different stages of their life as circumstances that may dictate their choices change as pass through the different stages of life.\n\nThis project seeks to assist these individuals with the information they would need to enable them to make informed decisions. The information will be updated continuously so that it will be useful to influence neighborhood choice decisions at all the stages of these individuals' life. "
